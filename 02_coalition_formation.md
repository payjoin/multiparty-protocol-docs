# Market based coalition formation for collaborative transaction construction

## Problem definition

In several existing market based decentralized protocols involving collaborative
transactions a single party initiates and typically bears the costs. For example
JoinMarket or liquidity ads.

Transactions meeting the demand of more than one "taker" can be more efficient
depending on their desired outcomes. CoinJoin privacy in particular is a
non-rivalrous positive externality obtained by each participant from the other
participants, and as such it is inherently positive sum.

The following protocol aims to generalize the type of order matching that
JoinMarket supports, allowing multiple users' intents to be aggregated together.

This is not a transaction construction protocol (e.g. WabiSabi), but a precursor
to such a protocol. This protocol bootstraps such a protocol by finding
consensus on initial set of UTXOs whose (honest) owners intend to spend in a
collaborative transaction. See the last section for a brief discussion of such
a protocol.

## Overview of proposed solution

This document describes a permissionless, peer to peer protocol for negotiating
collaborative transaction construction. This takes place over two primary
phases: bilateral negotiation followed by aggregation. Successful execution of
the protocol results in a coalition of UTXO owners unanimously deciding to
build a transaction together.

### Bilateral negotiation

A proposer, the owner of a UTXO, selects some other UTXOs and initiates peer to
peer bilateral negotiations with the owners of these coins by sending them a
message that includes a *co-spend proposal*. This expresses an intent to
cooperate to spend this set of coins together in a single Bitcoin transaction.

Co-spend proposals are publicly verifiable, confidential adjustments to the
effective values of the specified coins. These adjustments can represent
arbitrary incentive structures. Whether a proposal takes effect (the adjustment
is applied) is contingent on the constraints specified in the proposal being
satisfied by the transaction which spends the specified UTXOs. For example, a
proposal may require that non-SegWit inputs be excluded for txid stability, or
that the feerate be within an acceptable range, among other constraints.

Co-spend proposals rely on cryptography to keep each coin's adjustment hidden
except from the proposer and each coin's owner. The proposer's UTXO is
indistinguishable from the other UTXOs. Before a proposal is unanimously
accepted, it is not known which UTXO owners have accepted the proposal.

### Aggregation

Co-spend proposals are not exclusive. Many proposals can be aggregated together
before collaboratively constructing a transaction which in which the
combination of all the aggregated proposals is in effect. The UTXOs specified
in proposals that are aggregated together may overlap but don't need to, the
main requirement is for the constraints to be compatible.

Fully accepted proposals can be broadcast and then aggregated with other
compatible proposals. Aggregation makes it possible for multiple participants
to simulatenously optimize their outcome according to their individual
preferences. When they value privacy, this is a positive sum interaction and
aggregation optimizes the generated surplus.

To aggregate, several proposals are bundled together with a *coalition
proposal* that all parties must agree to. Unanimous acceptance of such a
coalition proposal signals that everyone is ready to construct a transaction.

Because transactions are only valid if all inputs are signed, multiparty
transaction require unanimous agreement. A precondition for denial of service
protection in privacy preserving multiparty transaction construction protocols
is incentive compatibility for the honest participants. No honest participant
should have a reason to withold their signature.

The primary purpose of this protocol is to construct an
[imputation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_%28game_theory%29), a
payoff distribution over the inputs, which aligns incentives for successful
transaction construction, while maintaining confidentiality of the individual
payoffs.

## Background

### Hedonic games and games with transferrable utility

Coalition formation games output a partition over $N$ peers. Finding stable
equilibria in such games is generally hard. Depending on the structures in the
preferences of the peers, many special cases described in the hedonic games
literature are still hard. In the byzantine setting appropriate for Bitcoin
protocols, no such structure can be assumed, which makes finding stable
partitions intractable.

Since the participants in the protocol unilaterally control independent UTXOs
during the execution of this protocol, we are constrained to the non-cooperative
setting, where agreements are non-binding and can't be enforced. Additionally,
for privacy the cost functions should remain hidden, so no mechanism can access
peers' preferences and globally optimize. Note that due to the nature of
revealed preferences the cost function can't be fully hidden.

Fortunately, the introduction of a transferrable utility greatly simplifies
finding stable coalition structures even under these assumption. Bitcoin can
approximate such a transferrable utility. This makes it possible to simply
assign payoffs to the coalitions and allow them to be distributed among the
peers through bilateral negotiation. If Alice prefers not to co-spend with Bob,
but Carol strongly favors both Alice's and Bob's participation, Carol is able to
compensate Alice, so that as long as the coalition generates some surplus all
parties will be able to obtain a positive payoff.

### Transaction construction liveness assumptions

For a coalition of $n \leq N$ peers, $f$ of which are adversarial, liveness for
transaction construction can be achieved (with privacy) by the honest subset of
peers in $O(f)$ time. Any defection requires transaction construction to start
over. Due to random network disruptions, necessarily some rate of (apparent)
defection must be tolerated.

Because exclusivity of spending attempts by inputs can't be enforced without
global consensus, and because transaction replacement is desirable for fee
market efficiency, we assume inputs are allowed to participate in concurrent
sessions which will result in conflicting transactions. Opt in signalling can be
used and obeyed as a courtesy, but this ultimately reduces to the same liveness
model as transaction construction, potentially requiring additional attempts to
recreate the transaction.

### Cost functions

This protocol is mostly agnostic to the cost function that describes the peers'
preferences.

Much like in the problem of coin selection (which this work seeks to
generalize), the cost function is denominated in sats, and is the combination of
objective terms (i.e. the fee cost) and subjective ones (any positive utility
obtained from transacting, which must dominate over the objective costs).

Although these are out of scope for this document, privacy related terms might
quantify things like how much cover other peers' coins provide as per the
sub-transaction model, perceived Sybil resistance against $n-1$ deanonymization
attacks (for instance an adversary using older coins incurs a higher cost to do
such an attack).

A precondition for liveness is that any such cost function is monotonically
decreasing in new information revealed during transaction construction.

Concretely, whenever the action of some peer is revealed (i.e. when an input or
output is added), at worst other peers should be indifferent to this, but they
may also obtain positive utility. If this is not the case, parties may
rationally choose to defect. The purpose of the constraints in proposals is to
allow the honest subset peers to avoid such non-malicious conflicts a priori,
since monotonicity is required for liveness a peer that engages in the protocol
without adhering to this restriction and refuses to sign is deviating from the
protocol, and therefore by definition not a member of the honest subset.

## Simplified example

Note that this example omits many details discussed below.

Alice, Bob, Carol and Dave are owners of UTXOs $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$
respectively.

Alice wishes to CoinJoin with Bob and Carol. She creates a co-spend proposal
with UTXOs $\{ A, B, C \}$. In this proposal she adjusts her UTXO $A$ down by
100 sats, and adjusts $B$ and $C$ up by 50 sats each, providing an incentive for
Bob and Carol to accept. She sends this to Bob and Carol, who accept, after
which the proposal is fully accepted and broadcast.

For all Bob knows, either Carol or Alice made the proposal, and the same goes
for Carol not knowing if it was Alice or Bob. Bob only learns that he was
offered 50 sats, he doesn't learn how much Carol (or whomever) was offered. All
Bob knows is that the 50 sats, which he would receive if a transaction was
constructed with this proposal in effect, would be paid for by one of the UTXOs
$\{A, C\}$.

Carol also wishes to CoinJoin, with Alice, and Dave. She creates a co-spend
proposal with UTXOs $\{ A, C, D \}$, and adjusts $C$ down by 50 sats, $A$ up by
20, and $D$ up by 30. This too is unanimously accepted and broadcast.

Dave then notices both proposals are compatible, and chooses to aggregate them
together. He produces a coalition proposal, which depends on these two
proposals. The coalition proposal chooses a specific feerate among other
things, combining the constraints of both previous proposals. It names $\{ A,
B, C, D \}$ as the UTXOs.

Once all parties accept Dave's proposal, consensus has been bootstrapped.
Everyone can derive the same total adjustments: $A - 80$, $B + 50$, $C + 0$,
$D + 30$. In general only the owner of each coin knows their final adjustment,
but in this example Carol knows that Dave obtained $+30$ because her proposal is
the only one that applies to his coin, and likewise Alice knows Bob obtained
$+50$.

All peers can then proceed to transaction construction, where each party is
entitled to add up to their adjusted value's worth in outputs. They may add
additional inputs, and arbitrary outputs so long as for each peer, the sum of
the outputs' effective cost does not exceed the sum of the adjusted effective
values of that peer's inputs.

## Technical Details

### Setup: BIP 322 gossip, online key enrollment

Every spendable coin could potentially be spent in a multiparty transaction
(although not all coins can be co-spent). To facilitate this we require a gossip
mechanism for BIP-322 ownership proofs, with a replacement and expiration
mechanism for flood protection, committing to a public key referred to as the
*online key* for the coin.

The purpose of this online key is to authenticate the owner of the UTXO without
requiring them to access the spending keys for communication. Anonymous
authentication requires the use of ring signatures (and are therefore less
likely to be supported by a HWW than BIP-322 proofs), and also simplify the
mapping to just a single public key per UTXO regardless of the complexity the
`scriptPubKey` might have (complex multisig or ambiguity from multiple spend
paths).

Ownership proofs are also used to estimate input weights. For P2TR outputs this
indicates the spend path that is intended to be used in any collaborative
transactions. Note however that this is not enforceable.

Each proof's endorsement of the online key has a validity interval specified in
terms of Bitcoin block height or MTU (valid-after and valid-until). When
multiple proofs by the same UTXO are nominally in effect, the one with the
latest expiry time takes precedence. Ownership proofs commit to a block hash
whose height or MTU is within some set interval of the valid-after field.

#### Flood protection

Online keys may need to be rotated. Since ownership proofs are tied to UTXOs
that provides some degree of Sybil protection (identities aren't costless
because UTXOs aren't costless), but that is insufficient for flood protection
with regards to gossipped messages, since unlike Bitcoin transaction gossip,
such messages do not consume any of the scarce resource.

Note that Sybil resistance for flood protection is considered separately of
Sybil resistance in the context of CoinJoin $n-1$ deanonymization attacks on
CoinJoins. That assumed to be encoded of the cost function, and therefore out
of scope for this protocol.

To be accepted (and propagated through gossip) by a peer, any newly made proof
associated with a coin must have a hash value (e.g. wtxid of the BIP 322
`to_sign` virtual transaction) numerically smaller all the other proofs already
associated with that output which are known to the peer.

Because ownership proofs may be valid at disjoint time intervals, a peer should
store up to $k$ proofs (in total, not per validity time interval) in its gossip
set for each candidate UTXO, so long as the hashes of *all* of these are
numerically smaller than $c_1 + 2^{(c_2 d k)}$, where $d$ is the total duration
of all proofs, and $c_i$ are dynamically set policy values (similar to
`minrelayfee`, based on local resource limits).

#### Precedence ordering

In addition to rudimentary flood protection for the ownership proof gossip,
this defines a clear precedence order. This is so that with respect to a
specific block tip, even without global consensus on the set of all ownership
proofs it's possible to efficiently to arrive the unambiguous mapping from a
particular set of UTXOs to the same set of online keys by sharing with peers
any relevant proofs a they might be missing.

If the online keys are generated by hash chain (similar to LN revocation keys),
revealing the key can revoke a previous ownership proof, forcing a linear
sequence of key updates and providing a mechanism for efficient revocation.
However it is unclear at the time of writing whether revocation is required at
all and the proof of work approach to flood protection seems sufficient.

Similarly, rate limiting could be done by restricting the rate of broadcast on
the basis of the committed block hash, but on its own this would not establish a
precedence order and in the absence of consensus on the set of ownership proofs
may result in ambiguities about which online key to use.

### Negotiation: listen advertisements and/or gossip of partially accepted proposals

Short lived listen advertisements may be signed by "makers" using their online
keys to indicate that the owner of a UTXO is soliciting proposals pertaining to
its spending over the named communication channel. Peers should only gossip
listen advertisements for currently active or soon to be active online keys.
The hash of the signature is used as a flood protection mechanism similarly to
ownership proofs.

"Takers" evaluate listening coins, and can construct proposals (defined in the
next section) over the specified communication channels.

Alternatively, negotiation with listening but unaddressible UTXO owners can be
made possible using an opt-in gossip layer. On this layer it is permitted to
broadcast partially accepted proposals. See below for a discussion of flood
protection considerations in this setting.

Listen advertisements can specify constraints for proposals being entertained,
indicating that proposals outside of the constrained subspace (see coalition
proposal details below for specifics) are unacceptable at any price.

Finally, listen advertisements also indicate the owner's willingness to serve
as a validator node in transaction construction, as either demanding to be a
one, opting in at the aggregator's discretion, or declining. The aggregator has
an incentive be a validator (and to do so honestly), but is not required to.

### Co-Spend Proposals

Co-spend proposals specify a set of outpoints of coins intended to be spent
together. Fully accepted proposals take effect contingent on the conditions
they specify, such as the range of feerates the offer is valid under,
`nLocktime` ranges, or whether or not txid stability is required (i.e. only
SegWit inputs). The effect of a proposal is some confidential redistribution of
the input funds, e.g. fees negotiated between the transacting parties.

#### Making and ratifying co-spend proposals

A proposal specifying $n$ UTXOs can have $1 \leq m \leq n$ linkable ring
signatures by the associated online keys of the named UTXOs.

While $m < $n$, a proposal is only partially accepted. Which of the peers have
accepted a partial proposal is kept hidden by the ring signatures. This
includes keeping the proposer anonymous within this set of signers; technically
the proposer is just the first to accept, and at least one peer needs to accept
for anti-Sybil flood protection reasons.

If $m=n$ linkable ring signatures with distinct key images have been collected,
then a proposal has been unanimously accepted.

Finally, for a proposal to be fully accepted the $n$ linkable ring signatures
are replaced with a single Schnorr signature made by the MuSig2 aggregate key
formed from the set of associated online keys of the UTXOs. This reduces the
the size as well as the computational cost of verifying proposals. Because all
parties have accepted, no single party can deny having signed making a joint
multisignature is semantically equivalent to a the $n$ individual linkable ring
signatures, the distinction is only meaningful during negotiations before all
parties have accepted.

Fully accepted proposals can then be broadcast for aggregation. A fully
accepted proposal ndicates that all owners of the specified UTXOs have some
interest in this proposal being in effect.

Individual proposals commit to a specific set of BIP 322 ownership proofs so
that the signatures on them are verifiable. Proposals that refer to expired
ownership proofs are still considered valid, and more generally proposals that
commit to different ownership proofs are potentially valid as long there is a
non-expired ownership proof associated with the UTXO, which is also used for
input weight estimations. See the coalition proposal section below for details.

Co-spend proposals are not updatable or revocable once fully accepted, but do
have an expiry (specified in block height, MTU, or UTC time). More than one
signature on the same proposal should be considered a flooding attack by all
participants, and honest parties should only sign (MuSig2) a proposal once.
Again, see below for discussion of flood protection with respect to partially
accepted proposals.

Co-spend proposals are however able to explicitly include conflict hints for
other proposals, indicating that (at least) the proposer of the conflicting
proposal would not accept a coalition proposal that depends on the excluded
proposals.

#### Effective value adjustments

Proposals verifiably redistribute sats among the UTXOs by adjusting their
effective values. Corresponding to each UTXO, a homomorphic value commitment to
an adjustment term is included. This adjustment can implement fee payments
between peers, and may be positive or negative for every UTXO.

The sum of all the adjustment value commitments in a proposal is a commitment to
the sum of the adjustments. This value, the *surplus* of a proposal, is included
in cleartext and the sum commitment is proven to commit to it in a balance
proof. This too may be positive or negative.

When communicating a partial proposal, the proposer shares with each recipient
the opening of the commitment associated with their UTXO. This payoff is
denominated in sats, and can be positive or negative.

Each adjustment value commitment is also covered by a range proof certifying
that the adjustment is a small positive or negative integer. Small means
at least $\lfloor\frac{v}{log_2(v)}\rfloor$, where $v$ is the minimal effective
value among all specified UTXOs. This minimum value is computed by taking the
highest acceptable feerate in the proposal conditions, and multiplying that by
the input weights estimated from the ownership proofs.

The sum of the adjustment commitments, when tweaked by the effective value of
the UTXO according to the final feerate of the UTXO, must be a commitment to a
positive number of sats. This is ensured by accounting for the maximum values in
the range proofs, and ensuring it doesn't overflow the effective value.

Imposing a minimal range width size imposes a limit on how many proposals can be
aggregated together, roughly logarithmic in the total value to be spent.
Proposals can use wider range proofs than the minimum, which limits their
ability to be aggregated and leaks information about the size of the
adjustments.

### Proposal aggregation and condition details

A coalition proposal is a special kind of co-spend proposal that aggregates
together a bundle of non-conflicting, fully accepted co-spend proposals. The
coalition proposal is made by one of the peers, the aggregator, to *all* other
peers implicated in the aggregation. The aggregator must also set specific
values for any constrained parameters (e.g. a concrete feerate not just a
range).

#### Making and ratifying coalition proposals

Any peer may attempt to construct a coalition proposal by aggregating unanimously
accepted co-spend proposals together, so long as it controls at least one of the
online keys implicated in the aggregation. For rate limiting, the aggregator's
key is made explicit and the hash of this signature is used for flood control
when gossipping partially signed coalition proposal, much like the hash of
ownership proofs.

Unlike co-spend proposals, coalition proposals are accepted with a regular
signature by the online key. This makes it tractable for aggregators to make
coalition proposals that revise the payoff or omit peers who did not accept. As
discussed above, coalition proposals are not mutually exclusive. If a peer
rejects a coalition proposal due to the inclusion of a specific proposal it may
broadcast a counter coalition proposal proposal of its own, so there is no
mechanism for explicit rejection.

A coalition proposal also specifies a concrete transaction construction
protocol version, and commits to a specific set of listen advertisements
associated with the specified UTXOs, which have either demanded or opted into
serving as validators. These peers agree to allow other peers to connect to
them and facilitate in gossip. Depending on the liveness requirements of
byzantine agreement for the subsequent transaction construction protocol, the
aggregator may specify validators at their discretion and named parties may
accept or decline.

#### Bootstrapping consensus for transaction construction

Once a coalition proposal is fully accepted, a coalition has been formed
complete with a payoff imputation. The online keys are used to initiate a
consensus protocol in order to construct the full transaction.

Since the coalition proposal addresses every UTXO, its ownership proof set
commitment is authoritative. This determines the canonical online key set for
the coalition, allowing a consensus protocol to be initialized. The aggregator
should use precedence ordering for symmetry breaking in order to minimize
additional gossip and improve the chances of the coalition proposal being
unanimously accepted, but there is no consensus state for these data at the
time the coalition proposal is being authored. The purpose of coalition
proposals is to bootstrap both the consensus protocol and incentive
compatibility to make use of it.

#### Coalition proposal structure

The surplus of all included co-spend proposals is added to the coalition
proposal's adjustment vector, which covers all UTXOs. The coalition proposal's
surplus must be positive and needs to cover the shared transaction fields at the
set feerate, but otherwise the aggregated surplus is at the discretion of the
aggregator, it may be claimed as a coordination fee, redistributed among all
parties arbitrarily or included in the mining fees.

The logical conjunction of co-spend proposals implies the union of their
adjusted UTXOs and the intersection of their conditions is in effect. The
per-UTXO adjustments are collected for each outpoint. The total adjustment for
each UTXO may not overflow its effective value, based on the range proof
widths.

Co-spend proposals therefore form a commutative semi-group, unioning the sets
of UTXOs and summing the adjustments component wise. It's only a semi-group
because proposals can't always be aggregated together. One reason for this that
the conditions might be mutually exclusive. Another is consensus rules (e.g.
`OP_CLTV` making conflicting assertions).

Conditions are intersected elementwise. The intersection of mutually exclusive
conditions, for example a time based vs. a height based nLocktime is empty,
precluding the combination of such proposals.

The following are all numerical intervals under intersection:

- Transaction consensus fields
  - version
  - individual flag bits
  - nIns
  - (nOuts constrains cannot be enforced and so can't be included)
  - nSequence (constrains all nSequence fields)
  - nLocktime
- Non consensus parameters
  - feerate
  - vbytes allocation per input (nIns must be set accordingly to pass standardness or consensus limits)

The following are sets under intersection

- Allowed input types

### Flood protection for partially accepted proposals

Partially accepted proposals can be communicated directly only between involved
peers, or gossipped to third parties. Gossip of partial proposals enables a
single proposer to make many nuisance offers involving different sets of keys.
Normally linkable ring signatures will protect their identity, which means
that other nodes can only use a statistical approach to detect the culprit and
may mistakenly penalize the UTXOs the attacker names, without their owners
contributing to this flooding attack. "Normally" means key image generator
point is just be a hash to curve of the proposal data itself, allowing
practically unlimited number of ring signatures per UTXO (exponential in the
size of the candidate UTXO set).

To limit this behavior the linkable ring signature key image base point can be
time dependent (e.g. making use of a sufficiently buried block's hash as a
randomness beacon) and include a truncated hash of the proposal when choosing
the generator (by hashing to the curve). Truncating to 10 bits, for example,
would allow up to 1024 unrelated proposals to be accepted or made by a single
UTXO equivocation per timestep, allowing flooding to be prevented (note however
honest users may be restricted from accepting some honest proposals due to the
birthday bound, but honest proposers with knowledge of other proposals can
grind the proposal data to avoid collisions, and we of course assume attackers
can do this without restriction).

Additionally, it is possible to make use of a verifiable encryption scheme for
the openings of the commitments, allowing verification of the proposal during
gossip, but this does not prevent the broadcast of nuisance proposals that
would not be accepted despite being formally valid.

In contrast, in the semi honest setting, and if acceptors don't mind revealing
whether they accept to the proposer, the linkable ring signatures can be short
cut entirely and MuSig2 negotiated directly, with the proposer as the
coordinator between all named parties. MuSig2 signing should still be initiated
concurrently even when linkable ring signatures are used in order to minimize
the number of round trip.

### PayJoin like payments in multiparty transactions

Payments requests or intents may be encoded in the co-spend proposals using the
value adjustment mechanism. Even if fully accepted, such proposals are merely
signalling the intention to pay, because finality is contingent on successful
collaborative transaction construction.

The sender and receiver must arrange for proposals to transfer the payment
amount. This can be achieved by the receiver extending the sender's proposal
with additional UTXOs (potentially of unrelated parties, although at least one
UTXO should be the receiver's in order to claim the adjustment, and multiple
proposals may be required to represent the full payment amount due to the range
proof width restriction). The sender and receiver must collaborate to produce a
balance proof, as only one or the other knows the openings of some of the
homomorphic value adjustments.

With this approach fallback transactions as in BIPs 79-7 is no longer as
prudent, since the receiver's UTXOs are much harder to probe. Neither sender
nor receiver needs to disclose any UTXOs to each other, only the payment amount
is fully known to both.

Although out of scope for this document, peers also negotiate the payment
details out of band and arrange for valid registration of the receiver outputs
during transaction construction. In this setting the receiver does not need to
contribute a UTXO at all and may still get privacy from the sender since their
output(s) may be ambiguous, and there are no limitations arising from the use
of width limited range proofs.

### Post quantum security & privacy

Apart from the BIP-322 ownership proofs, which are related to spending keys,
the signatures used throughout do not require PQ security for privacy (assuming
perfectly hiding commitments) or safety, but only for liveness.

However, for privacy it is important that any proofs of knowledge of openings
of the commitments do not compromising the unconditional hiding of commitments
in order to avoid "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks on anonymity (although
out of the scope of this document, this is also required for transaction
construction).

Secondly, in addition to the secp256k1 online key, a PQ key for end to end
encrypted communication (e.g. the encrypted openings of commitments included in
a proposal) can also be used. HPKE is an obvious choice for secp256k1 based
encryption, and hybrid HPKE is specified using ML-KEM which makes it a
relatively simpler change, but neither these is verifiable without general
purpose ZK, which is often costly for the prover or in proof size. Lattice
based schemes (without a symmetric cipher) seem potentially amenable to such
verifiable encryption, but I have yet to look into that. Verifiable encryption
is necessary for partial proposal gossip, as otherwise there is no guarantee
that the proposal can even be accepted, as some parties may not learn the
opening of the value commitments associated with their UTXOs.

Finally, PQ privacy must of course also assume that metadata privacy at the
transport layer is also preserved.

### Transaction construction protocol

A protocol similar to WabiSabi can provide liveness, although in this setting
WabiSabi's reliance on KVACs would require one of the peers to serve as the
coordinator, and it would be trusted. With modification, this coordinator could
prove all transcript messages it accepted are valid, but may still arbitrarily
censor certain operations, causing a UTXO to be unfairly blamed for failing to
sign.

Technically the coalition proposal can implement a coordination fee mechanism, for
example by making all adjustments be slightly negative apart from that of the
coordinator (which may or may not be the aggregator). This provides the
coordinator with an incentive to coordinate honestly on average. Unfortunately
this does little for any targetted censorship risk so long as the payoff from
censorship (of e.g. a specific TxOut) dominates over the expected loss of
revenue from sabotaging a single attempt at transaction construction. It is
likely that the majority of the revenue is still recoverable in a subsequent
blame round, as the other participants have no indication that censorship has
occurred.

For a more robust mechanism, coalition formation outputs a set of online keys
for a coalition, and among other things these are intended to be used to implement
byzantine fault tolerant state machine replication for transaction
construction. The initial state, based on the coalition proposal, can be proven
valid with respect to each UTXO's adjustment sum commitments, which enforces
that the agreed to imputation is in effect.

The state machine collects inputs and outputs of a transaction (or tree of
transactions a la CoinJoinXT). Since state messages are self authenticating,
authenticating using zero knowledge proofs (anonymous credentials or ring
signatures), they can be posted anonymously much like in a permissioned
blockchain, where all peers act as validators.
