# Concurrent PSBT Construction

## Abstract

New fields and rules for combining PSBTs in a distributed setting. This
provides an alternative to the BIP 370 constructor role that is less sensitive
to order of operations and therefore more amenable to concurrency, which reduces
the coordination required for collaborative transaction construction.

## Motivation

BIP 174 defines *Combiner* functionality. Its purpose is to integrate
information add by either the *Updater* or *Signer* roles to divergent copies
of a PSBT. According to the specification the combiner is intended for for
PSBTs whose underlying unsigned transactions are identical, i.e. it is
restricted to the *Updater* and *Signer* roles.

BIP 370 introduced a *Constructor* role, which allows signalling that the
inputs or outputs of a PSBT are modifiable. Arbitrary mutation of the inputs
and outputs is then allowed, but this assumes such state updates are done
sequentially. The combiner role is mostly unchanged in BIP 370, and is
restricted to only allow combining fields of PSBTs which spend and create
the same outputs, and in the same order. This facilitates aggregating
signatures from multiple parties in any order, but has limited usefulness
during the construction of the PSBT.

In a distributed system it is easier to deliver messages without guaranteeing
the order of delivery is consistent across nodes. Agreement on the set of
outputs to spend and a set of outputs to create is sufficient for constructing
a transaction, it isn't necessary to agree on the order in which they were
added. This document defines an order insensitive merging procedure which
generalizes the *Combiner* role to non-identical modifiable PSBTs which may
still overlap in some of their data. To terminate concurrent transaction
construction, a consistent ordering procedure is also defined for producing a
a consistent PSBT which can subsequently be manipulated using the normal BIP
174 roles.

## Specification

TODO diagram for the combined state machine, indicate when downconversion (to v2 or v0) can happen

    creator -> constructor<modifiable, unordered> -> constructor<modifiable> (bip 370) -> updater -> signer -> combiner -> finalizer -> extractor

TODO discuss scrubbing after signer and before combiner

The new field types for distributed PSBT construction are as follows:

### New global types

| Name | `keytype` | `keydata` | `keydata` Description | `valuedata` | `valuedata` Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transaction Unordered Flag | `PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_UNORDERED = TBD` | None | No key data | `<8-bit uint>` | If present, must be set to a value `0x03` to indicate inputs and outputs are unordered. |
| Sort Seed | `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED = TBD` | None | No key data | `<bytes globalseed>` | Random seed used to derive deterministic sort keys when explicit per-map sort keys are absent. |
| Deterministic Sort Flag | `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_DETERMINISTIC = TBD` | None | No key data | `<8-bit uint>` | A value of `0x01` indicates sort keys must be deterministically derived and explicit `PSBT_IN_SORT_KEY` / `PSBT_OUT_SORT_KEY` fields are disallowed. A value of `0x00` indicates sort keys are required and `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED` is disallowed. |
| Removed Input | `PSBT_GLOBAL_REMOVED_INPUT = TBD` | `<bytes input unique id>` | `PSBT_IN_UNIQUE_ID`  of an input removed from the logical input set. | None | No value data. |
| Removed Output | `PSBT_GLOBAL_REMOVED_OUTPUT = TBD` | `<bytes output unique id>` | `PSBT_OUT_UNIQUE_ID` removed from the logical output set. | None | No value data. |

### New per-input types

| Name | `keytype` | `keydata` | `keydata` Description | `valuedata` | `valuedata` Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input Sort Key | `PSBT_IN_SORT_KEY = TBD` | None | No key data | `<bytes sort key>` | Arbitrary lexicographically comparable value used to order inputs. |
| Input Unique ID | `PSBT_IN_UNIQUE_ID = TBD` | None | No key data | `<bytes unique id>` | Optional unique suffix for outpoint identity, used for input removal extensions. |

### New per-output types

| Name | `keytype` | `keydata` | `keydata` Description | `valuedata` | `valuedata` Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Output Unique ID | `PSBT_OUT_UNIQUE_ID = TBD` | None | No key data | `<bytes unique id>` | Universally unique identifier for output map identity under unordered output semantics. |
| Output Sort Key | `PSBT_OUT_SORT_KEY = TBD` | None | No key data | `<bytes sort key>` | Arbitrary lexicographically comparable value used to order outputs when transitioning from unordered to ordered mode. |

### PSBT identity and transaction effects

The BIP 174 *Combiner* role specifies how to merge diverging copies of the same
PSBT. PSBTs are considered "the same", by identifying them based on the
unsigned transaction. Two PSBTs with the same unsigned transaction but
potentially different key value pairs are considered two versions of the same
PSBT.

BIP 370 introduces the notion of a [unique
ID](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0370.mediawiki#user-content-Unique_Identification)
which is computed as a hash that commits to UTXOs being spent and the new outputs
being created, thereby ensuring PSBTs with the same ID have the same structure,
but abstracting away some details of the transaction, thereby introducing a
notion of equivalence that is a bit more general.

The effects of a transaction on the distribution of money are determined by its
effects the UTXO set: which outputs does it spend and create. However, with
regards to money changing hands, we would like to treat equivalent outputs as
interchangeable by disregarding the specific outpoints by which specific coins
are identified.

Both notions of identity ensure that PSBTs with the same ID have the same
effects, but it is not true that PSBTs with the same effects will have the same
ID, since depends on the specific order of the inputs and outputs, among other
things. By abstracting over these details we obtain a more general notion of
PSBT identity than in BIP 370. The details of how to compute this ID are
[provided below](#unique-identifiers).

### Combiner role and transaction effects

The BIP 174 *Combiner* role requires that the PSBTs have the same identity. In
order to relax this constraint and allow the *Combiner* role to be used in
conjunction with (a more general notion of) the *Constructor* role, the
*Combiner* role has to be made more conservative in other regards.

BIP 174 specifies that fields with duplicate keys and more than one distinct
value may be combined by [picking one of the values
arbitrarily](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki#handling-duplicated-keys).
This is safe within the scope of BIP 174 because any inconsistency will only
affect the validity of a transaction. In other words, when choosing one value
over another for a duplicate field, although signing may fail to produce a
valid signature, no money will be lost because if the IDs are the same, the the
effects are identical.

This notion of safety can be extend beyond just combining signing related data,
so that effects of a transaction formed by combining PSBTs do not depend in any
way on the order in which the PSBTs were combined, nor even on combination
being done sequentially. Note that this does not require that the effects of
the constituent PSBT be identical, only that all of them are combined at some
point. More formally, in order to be safe, combining should be monotone in the
transaction effects.

Unfortunately choosing between conflicting values arbitrarily does not preserve
this notion of safety when merging PSBTs where the inputs or outputs of one
PSBT don't correspond to the inputs or outputs which occupy the same positions
in the second PSBT. For example, if the first inputs of two PSBTs spend
different coins, and one PSBT takes precedence, the input in the other
transaction will be omitted. If the `PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID` field of one PSBT
overrides the other but this precedence is reversed for `PSBT_IN_OUTPUT_INDEX`,
the one remaining input will be corrupted.

#### `joinpsbts` vs. the Combiner role

Bitcoin Core additionally implements a `joinpsbts` RPC command which does
allow merging PSBTs with different identities, so long as their spent output
sets are disjoint.

`joinpsbts` is not idempotent with respect to inputs (writing it as $+$,
idempotence would mean that $A + A = A$). Attempting to join a PSBT more than
once fails closed: if $B$ contains an input, and $A + B$ is defined, then $(A +
B) + B$ will fail, because a transaction cannot spend the same coin twice.

`joinpsbts` is also not idempotent with respect to the outputs, but
unfortunately also does not fail closed, potentially leading to overspending:
if $B$ contains just an output, then $B + B$ will contain two copies of that
output.

Although not strictly associative or commutative, due to use of shuffling, in
regards to transaction effects it does hold that $(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)$
and that $A + B = B + A$.

#### Strict Combiner

In order for combination being deterministic, idempotent and commutative and
associative in regards to transaction effects, when either bits 0 or 1 of
`PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE` are set, indicating the transaction is modifiable,
instead of choosing arbitrarily the strict *Combiner* MUST fail whenever
duplicate fields have conflicting (unequal) values.

Exceptions to this are detailed in the next sections, preserving idempotence,
commutativity and associativity.

This establishes a more conservative foundation for ensuring that the effects
of a transaction formed by combining a set of PSBTs will always be the same
regardless how these PSBTs were combined to obtain a complete transaction.

### Unordered input and output sets

Since transaction effects are invariant under permutations of the inputs or
outputs, treating the inputs and outputs as unordered sets as opposed to order
lists allows safe combining to be defined for PSBTs that are not identical.

To represent this we define a global field `PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_UNORDERED`,
indicating whether the order of inputs and outputs should be ignored. The value
is an unsigned 8 bit integer and if present must be set to `0x03`, indicating
the transaction in unordered.

Rationale: Since there is no known use case that requires input or output to be
marked unordered or ordered separately from each other, that is omitted from
the spec. The value `0x03` simplifies forward compatibility with any
specification that might amend this by allowing either bit to be set
independently, so long as it overlaps with this specification when both are
set.

If set, the `Has SIGHASH_SINGLE` flag of `PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE` must not
be set. `SIGHASH_SINGLE` inputs [MUST not be
used](#divergence-and-sighash-flags) in unordered transactions.

Unordered PSBTs MUST be shuffled prior to reserialization. This is easily
accomplished by storing them in randomized hashmaps, keyed by their unique
identifiers as defined below. If all inputs and outputs have [sort
keys](#ordering-inputs-and-outputs), the key based ordering may be used instead
of shuffling.

[fn:Join is implicitly defined on equivalence class of all permutations of
inputs/outputs, but the PSBT contents is a random representative.

Rationale: Not shuffling presents a privacy hazard, leaking information about
the sequence of actions leading to a transaction's construction. When a
transaction is unordered, shuffling by definition doesn't change its meaning,
but ensures the incidental order can't accidentally be relied upon.

#### Combining PSBTs with different identities

When `PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_UNORDERED` is set, the input or output maps are no longer
distinguished by their index, but instead by a unique identifier defined for
each input or output.

Inputs or outputs with identical unique IDs (those which are present in both
PSBTs) are merged by combining their key-value pairs with the stricter,
idempotent combination defined above.

These sets of combined inputs and outputs are then unioned with any inputs or
outputs from that have distinct unique identifiers (i.e. are only present in
one of the PSBTs, and therefore aren't combined with a counterparts). Distinct
identifiers are only allowed if the corresponding `PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE`
flag is set, because such combinations represent additions of inputs or
outputs. If this is not the case but a distinct input or output is present,
then combining must fail.

#### Unique identifiers for inputs

Inputs are identified by their outpoint, i.e. the tuple of their
`PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID` and `PSBT_IN_OUTPUT_INDEX`, both of which must be set.

#### Unique identifiers for outputs

Outputs are identified by a new `PSBT_OUT_UNIQUE_ID` field, which must be
universally unique (e.g. 16 bytes of randomness).

This ensures that repeated addition of the same output is idempotent, but that
if two different distributed constructors both attempt to add an identical
output (same `PSBT_OUT_VALUE` and `PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT`), that will still result in
two copies of the output as intended. This is important because a transaction
with only a single copy will appear correct but end up losing the value of all
missing copies to mining fees.

Outputs with an identical `PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT` can be merged, and their values
summed together after `PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_UNORDERED` is cleared and an order is
determined, using BIP 370 construction rules. See the next section on ordering.

### Ordering inputs and ouputs

- TODO: unique ID can be derived by sorting even if sort key is empty, but txn
  finalization must not be unless all sort keys are provided explicitly
  (regardless of DETERMINISTIC)
- add section for unique ID derivation a la BIP 370

Clearing the `PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_UNORDERED` field indicates the order of the inputs
and outputs. Due to the shuffling requirement, the given order will in general
not be consistent across replicas if this is done without determining an order,
resulting in diverging unsigned transactions.

For consistent ordering we define `PSBT_IN_SORT_KEY` and `PSBT_OUT_SORT_KEY`
fields for inputs and outputs respectively, that may include up to 32 bytes of
arbitrary data, used as a sort key for lexicographical sorting.

If the global field `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_DETERMINISTIC` is set (unsigned 8 bit
integer) to `0x01`, then sort keys MUST NOT be set, and `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED`
MUST be set and contain at least 128 bits of randomness.

If `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_DETERMINISTIC` is set to `0x00`, explicit sort keys are
required to be set and used prior to clearing the `PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_UNORDERED`
field and fixing the transaction order.

If any `PSBT_IN_SORT_KEY` and `PSBT_OUT_SORT_KEY` are omitted, the global
`PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED` field is set, and `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_DETERMINISTIC` is
either omitted or set to `0x01`, the sort keys are derived deterministically. A
missing `PSBT_IN_SORT_KEY` is derived as `H(PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED ||
PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID || PSBT_IN_OUTPUT_INDEX)` and `PSBT_OUT_SORT_KEY` as
`H(PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED || PSBT_OUT_UNIQUE_ID)`, where `H_s` is a BIP 341
style tagged hash, with the tag preimage being `BIP ???? deterministic
ordering` (TODO pick a real domain separator).

If any sort key is missing, ordering can only proceed after
`PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED` is set.

A *Creator* creating an unordered transaction SHOULD set
`PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_DETERMINISTIC` to enure consistent ordering rules are
enforced.

For sufficiently large transactions the ordering itself (and therefore the per
input signatures) is a cryptographically binding commitment to the
`PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED` value. This is because the entropy of the ordering of
$n$ elements is $log_2(n!)$. For reference, $\log_2(35!) > 128$, $\log_2(25!) >
80$, and $\log_2(15!) > 40$.

This can provides additional integrity to a collaborative transaction
construction protocol, since [`SIGHASH_ALL`](#divergence-and-sighash-flags)
signatures must agree on the ordering.

In applications where this is desirable, the *Creator* should only set
`PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_DETERMINISTIC` to `0x01`, and leave `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED`
unset. Each replica will locally provide a value for `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED`
just in time, as a commitment to protocol transcript (e.g. the root hash of a
Merkle set of protocol messages).

If that is not the case, the *Creator* should initialize
`PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED` with sufficient randomness thereby ensure some order
can always be determined, or set `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_DETERMINISTIC` to `0x00` to
indicate explicit sort keys are required..

TODO global sort seed || hash of fee contributions or expect application to
commit to that in transcript if appropriate?

TODO: Rationale for allowing explicit sort key: lightning interactive-tx
`serial_id` field. should always use odd parity form, encoded in network order
so that lexicographical sorting works the same as the interactive-tx sorting
rule.

### Unique identification of unordered PSBTs

In order to derive unique IDs as in BIP 370 for unordered transactions, the
`PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED` and `PSBT_IN_SORT_KEY` and `PSBT_OUT_SORT_KEY` fields
are cleared, and then the ordering procedure of the previous section is used
without the restriction of a non-empty `PSBT_GLOBAL_SORT_SEED` (sorting with an
empty seed).

TODO: domain separation from PSBT v2, it doesn't make sense to treat an ordered
BIP 370 PSBT as the same PSBT even if it agrees on its content when it doesn't
agree that the order is meaningless. how to do this? hashing output unique IDs
of outputs is insufficient for domain separation of input only partially
constructed PSBTs, but maybe that's OK.

### Divergence and SIGHASH flags

Signers MUST sign only using `SIGHASH_ALL`.

If `SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` or `SIGHASH_NONE` is used by a signer, the signature
is valid for an (ill defined) equivalence class of transactions, with
non-equivalent transaction effects.

At minimum any such signature could lead to txid malleability, and so is not
composable with any protocol that requires pre-signed descendant transactions.

Furthermore, members of this equivalence class of transactions may differ
substantially in their effects, potentially leading to loss of funds, not only
due to byzantine faults but even omission faults. To ensure undesired
transactions are not inadvertantly authorized, the full output list should
always be comitted to using `SIGHASH_ALL`.

Rationale: No known use cases for such flags in true multiparty transactions
(i.e. three or more parties). If necessary, a carve out can be specified in a
separate document (e.g. for kickstarter-style crowdfunding with
`SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY|SIGHASH_ALL` signing).

### Confirmation of successful payment prior to signing

Parties which neither send nor receive payments within a transaction can safely
sign so long as all of their intended outputs are covered by the input
signature. This may require signing more than once if some messages are
delayed, but TODO see also termination via explicit fee contributions.

If there is any net transfer between the parties, it is insufficient for a
sender (any party that makes an outgoing payment to another party within the
transaction regardless of their net send/receive balance) to rely only on the
signature comitting to the outputs they added, because some of their funds will
be used by other parties and their actions need to have been registered as
well.

Before signing, every sender must wait until it has positive confirmation of
the PSBT's unique ID (which commits to the full output set) from every one of
its receivers, and that in every case the confirmed ID matches the one they
derive locally.

Every recevier whose net balance is non-negative (they may be a sender too but
they receive at least as much as they send) can confirm the unique PSBT ID to
their respective senders output set contains all of their added outputs.

Every receiver whose balance is net negative (they send more than they receive)
must wait for confirmation from all receivers for whom it is a sender before it
confirms the unique ID to the senders for whom it is a receiver.

If there is a cyclic payment graph, for example Alice pays Bob, Bob pays Carol,
and Carol pays Alice, net positive receivers can safely initiate confirmations,
breaking the circular dependency, because senders will sign will only occur
after all receivers have confirmed and if all net positive receivers have
confirmed then all funds are accounted for. At least one such node must exist
in every cyclic payment structure, since the sum of the payments along a cycle
will be 0.

If there is any mismatch in the confirmations, either the receiver or the
sender has not yet received the full message set. If a receiver learns of an
additional input or output after previously confirming, they must confirm the
new unique ID which incorporates this additional data. If a sender learns of an
additional input or output, they can derive a new unique ID, and stop waiting
if this matches all of their receivers' confirmations.

Such a confirmation mechanism does not require an agreement or consensus
mechanism, only eventual consistency. If messages are guaranteed to be
delivered eventually then every receiver will eventually confirm a consistent
least upper bound.

TODO sender/receiver examples, including an example with a receiver that contributes no inputs, only outputs

TODO net-sender, net-receiver, explain in terms of breaking cyclic graph to a tree with net-receivers
at the leaves, propagate confirmation up the chain.

### Input or output removal (optional)

As in BIP 174, the combination of several PSBTs must contain all the key-value
pairs from each of the input PSBTs.

If support for removal of inputs and outputs is needed, two global fields
`PSBT_GLOBAL_REMOVED_INPUT` and `PSBT_GLOBAL_REMOVED_OUTPUT` can be used to
represent a [two phase
set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#2P-Set_(Two-Phase_Set))
by specifying the inputs or outputs to be removed in the keydata. Inputs or
outputs whose unique IDs are specified must be pruned from the input or output.

Because inputs are identified by outpoint, an input spending the same coin as
an input whose outpoint is in the set of removed inputs can't normally be
added. Therefore we introduce an optional `PSBT_IN_UNIQUE_ID` field, whose
value (if provided) is appended to the outpoint.

Support for removal is entirely optional. Implementations may explicitly fail
when combining with a PSBT that sets either `PSBT_GLOBAL_REMOVED_INPUT` or
`PSBT_GLOBAL_REMOVED_OUTPUT`, but completely ignoring these fields is fail
safe.

Assuming [`SIGHASH_ALL` is used](#divergence-and-sighash-flags), it's
sufficient to simply rely on the signature hashing. If an output was removed, a
peer which does not implement removal it will diverge from those that do, and
therefore produce a signature that will not be valid for the transaction
supporting peers will produce and subsequently sign, and vice versa, ensuring
that neither transaction is valid.

This optionality extends the `PSBT_IN_UNIQUE_ID` field, a removal and
re-insertion with incompatible data will either cause combination to fail due
to a mismatch or succeed by ignoring the removal and treating the insertion as
idempotent, but otherwise diverge.

While this would allow limited interoperability among clients, that is not
reccomended, and is described as an argument for the safety of omitting any
removal related functionality. Implementations which omit removal functionality
SHOULD fail or at least warn if combining a PSBT that signals removal.

TODO: while combine is monotone of data / PSBT fields including removals, it is
no longer monotone in transaction effects. This does not present a safety issue
if [only `SIGHASH_ALL` is used](#divergence-and-sighash-flags).

Rationale for optionality: not implementing is safe, couldn't find usage of
`tx_remove_{input,output}`, non-monotonic state makes termination / limits
trickier.

TODO for interactive-tx, set `PSBT_IN_UNIQUE_ID` to odd parity `serial_id`.
this makes it possible to support `tx_remove_{input,output}` operations.

### PSBT CRDT (optional)

In some circumstances a conflict free replicated data type (CRDT) can be
defined as a subtype of (unordered) PSBTs. In a CRDT, in addition to being
idempotent, commutative and associative, combination is additionally
[guaranteed to succeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semilattice).

Success here means producing a useful output, which ideally would guarantee a
transaction that would be valid if fully signed, which also conforms to
standardness policy. This can only be guaranteed under assumptions that must be
realized by some additional protocol, beyond the scope of this document.

#### Mutually exclusive inputs

Two `OP_CLTV` encumbered coins, one with a height based and one with a time
based `nLocktime` constraint will impose mutually exclusive validity
requirements on their spending transactions, and therefore cannot be spent
together in the same transaction.

In order to ensure the least upper bound of any two inputs under consideration
not only can be defined, but will correspond to a valid transaction, the
*Creator* role can restrict the domain of spendable inputs before inputs are
added.

TODO `PSBT_GLOBAL_{REQUIRED,MAXIMUM}_{HEIGHT,TIME}_LOCKTIME` height and time
separately or just integer range? separately is consistent with other PSBT
specs. a single nlocktime interval field with two unsigned integers, required
and max-required would make many invalid states unrepresentable, but is more
fiddly and unfamiliar.

#### Size Limits

advisory fields: `MAX_WEIGHT_PER_PARTICIPANT`, `MAX_TRANSACTION_WEIGHT`
(default 400000?) - determines max number of participants while also signalling
size limit is enforced

if every participant effectively restricts the domain by respecting the limit
the least upper bound is guaranteed not to exceed the limit making the join valid.

assumes the number of partcipants can be restricted via some external mechanism.

#### Termination

knowing when to proceed to signing

- global fee contribution
  - `PSBT_GLOBAL_EXPLICIT_FEE_CONTRIBUTION`
  - keydata = 16 byte uuid
  - value = u64 amount of funds explicitly contributed as fees
  - needs `PSBT_IN_NON_WITNESS_UTXO` or `PSBT_IN_WITNESS_UTXO` for nominal value
  - effective values/costs would a specific feerate and input size estimation,
    instead all such fee contributions should also be added (but can be
    computed deterministically in case this is known)

inputs before outputs?
only rely on payment ACKs
